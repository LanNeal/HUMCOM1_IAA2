    <h2>Axie Infinity</h2>
    <dd>Axie Infinity was released in March 2018. It is a monster-battling game where you pit teams of cute monsters called Axies against each other in battles. The game runs on the Ethereum blockchain with the help of Ronin, a sidechain that helps minimize fees and transaction delays. It's primarily focused on turn-based battles, either against computer-controlled Axie teams or live opponents over the Internet. You can also breed Axies, which lets you build potentially more powerful teams and yields additional NFTs to sell on the marketplace. Some Axie NFTs have sold for as much as 300 ETH apiece, or more than $600,000 as of this writing.</dd>

    <h2>How does Axie works?</h2>
    <dd>As mentioned, Axie Infinity is built entirely around NFT items and right now, there’s no way to play unless you buy the three Axie NFTs needed to create your first team.

        They can be purchased from the official Axie marketplace via your Ronin wallet, which you’ll connect to the game. You can play on PC, Mac, Android, or iOS and take your Axies into battle to win rewards.</dd>

    <h2>Where can you buy AXS?</h2>
    <dd>AXS is available from cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, FTX, and Huobi Global. You will need a crypto wallet with ETH or another Ethereum-based ERC20 token to trade at Uniswap. If you need ETH, you can purchase it with fiat money at Coinbase or Binance and then transfer it to your wallet. </dd>

    <h2>Axie Gamemode</h2>
    <dd>The game features two different gaming modes; Adventure Mode and Arena Mode. Adventure Mode is player-versus-environment based and consist of different levels. In this mode, players will have to fight against computer-controlled mobs in order to complete a level, while Arena Mode is player-versus-player based and consist of different matches. This mode is recommended for experienced players with maximum level Axies.</dd>

    <h2>Axie Gameplay</h2>
    <dd>In the game, players can collect, battle, bread, raise and trade creatures known as Axies, which are digitized as NFTs. It is recommended that new players adopt at least three Axies from the Marketplace, before playing the game. In October 2018, the Axie core team released the first battle system built on top of the Axie game assets. The battle system was structured as an "idle battle" system with inspiration from games like "Final Fantasy Tactics" and "Idle Heroes".
        The Axie team started development on the real-time card battle system and application in March 2019 and released an Alpha in December 2019. As of October 2020, the Application has amassed over 15,000 downloads with over 7,000 weekly active users.
        Much like Pokemon has gone through numerous iterations and types of battle systems, we also expect Axie to have many variations of battles over the years to come.</dd>
